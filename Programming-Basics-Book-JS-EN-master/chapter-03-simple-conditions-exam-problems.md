# Chapter 3.2. Simple Conditions – Exam Problems

In the previous chapter, we went through the simple conditional statements in **JavaScript**, which we can use to execute different actions depending on a given condition. We mentioned what is the scope of a variable (it's **`scope`**) and how to track the execution of our program step by step (the so-called **debugging**). In this chapter, working with simple conditions by going through some exam tasks. To do this, let's first revise their construction:

```JavaScript
if (bool expression) {
    // condition body;
} else {
    // else-construction body;
}
```

**`if` conditions** consist of:
 * **`if` clause**
 * **bool expression** - a variable of bool type (**`Boolean`**) or bool logical expression (an expression that results in **`true/false`**)
 * **condition body** - contains a random block of source code
 * **`else` clause** and its block of source code (**optional**)

 
## Exam Problems

After having revised how to write simple conditions, let's solve a few exam problems to practice the **`if-else`** construction:

## Problem: Transport Price

A student has to travel **n kilometers**. He can choose between **three types of transportation**: 
* **Taxi**. Starting fee: **0.70** BGN. Day rate: **0.79** BGN/km. Night rate: **0.90** BGN/km.
* **Bus**. Day / Night rate: **0.09** BGN/km. Can be used for distances of a minimum of **20** km.
* **Train**. Day / Night rate: **0.06** BGN/km. Can be used for distances of a minimum of **100** km.

Write a program that reads the number of **kilometers n** and **period of the day** (day or night) and calculates **the price for the cheapest transport**.

### Input Data

**Two lines** (arguments) are read from the console:
* The first line (arguments) contains a number **n** – number of kilometers – an integer in the range of [**1 … 5000**].
* The second line contains the word "**day**" or "**night**" – traveling during the day or the night.

### Output Data

Print on the console **the lowest price** for the given number of kilometers.

### Sample Input and Output

| Input        | Output       | Input        | Output       |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|5<br>day    |4.65        |7<br>night  |7           |

| Input        | Output       | Input        | Output       |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|25<br>day   |2.25        |180<br>night|10.8        |

### Hints and Guidelines

We will read the input data and depending on the distance, we will choose the cheapest transport. To do that, we will write a few conditional statements.

#### Processing The Input Data

In the task, we are given **information about the input and output data**. Therefore, the first part of the task is to declare and initialize two **variables** where we will store the **values of the input data**:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/01.Transport-price-01.png)

Before starting with the conditional statements, we need to **declare** one more **variable** that stores the value of **the transport price**:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/01.Transport-price-02.png)

#### Checking The Conditions and Calculating

After having **declared and initialized** the input data and the variable that stores the value of the price, we have to decide which **conditions** of the task have to be **checked first**. 

The task specifies that the rates of two of the vehicles **do not depend** on whether it is **day** or **night**, but the rate of one of the transports (taxi) **depends**. This is why the **first condition** will be whether it is **day or night** so that it is clear which rate the taxi will be **using**. To do that, we **declare one more variable** that stores **the value of the taxi rate**:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/01.Transport-price-03.png)

To calculate **the taxi rate**, we will use a conditional statement of type **`if-else`**:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/01.Transport-price-04.png)

After having done that, now we can start calculating **the transport price** itself. The constraints in the task refer to **the distance** that the student wants to travel. This is why, we will use an **`if-else`** statement that will help us find **the price** of the transport, depending on the given kilometers:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/01.Transport-price-05.png)

First, we check whether the kilometers are **less than 20**, as the task specifies that the student can only use **a taxi** for **less than 20 kilometers**. If the condition is **true** (returns **`true`**), the variable that is created to store the value of the transport (**`price`**), will **store** the corresponding value. This value equals **the starting fee** that we will **sum** with its **rate**, **multiplied** by **the distance** that the student has to travel.

If the condition of the variable **is not true** (returns **`false`**), the next step of our program is to check whether the kilometers are **less than 100**. We do that because the task specifies that in this range, **a bus** can be used as well. **The price** per kilometer of a bus **is cheaper** than a taxi one. Therefore, if the result of the condition is **true**, we store **a value**, equal to the result of the **multiplication** of **the rate** of the bus by **the distance** to the variable for the transportation **`price`** in the **`else if`** statement body.

If this condition **does not return `true`** as a result, we have to store **a value**, equal to **the result** of **the multiplication** of **the distance** by the train **rate** to the price variable in the **`else`** body. This is done because the train is **the cheapest** transport for the given distance. 

#### Printing The Output

After we have checked the distance conditions and we have **calculated the price of the cheapest transport**, we have to **print it**. The task **does not** specify how to format the result, therefore, we just print **the variable**:

## Problem: Pipes In Pool

A pool with **volume V** fills up via **two pipes**. **Each pipe has a certain flow rate** (the liters of water, flowing through a pipe for an hour). A worker starts the pipes simultaneously and goes out for **N hours**. Write a program that finds the state of the pool **the moment the worker comes back**. 

### Input Data

**Four numbers are passed to the function** (arguments):
* The first line (argument) contains a number **V – the volume of the pool in liters** – an integer in the range of [**1 … 10000**].
* The second line (argument) contains a number **P1 – the flow rate of the first pipe per hour** – an integer in the range of [**1 … 5000**].
* The third line (argument) contains a number **P2 – the flow rate of the second pipe per hour** – an integer in the range of [**1 … 5000**].
* The fourth line (argument) contains a number **H – the hours that the worker is absent** – a floating-point number in the range of [**1.0 … 24.00**].

### Output Data

Print on the console **one of the two possible states**:
* To what extent the pool has filled up and how many percent each pipe has contributed. All percent values must be formatted to an integer (without rounding).

  * "The pool is **[x]**% full. Pipe 1: **[y]**%. Pipe 2: **[z]**%."
* If the pool has overflown – with how many liters it has overflown for the given time – a floating-point number. 
  * "For **[x]** hours the pool overflows with **[y]** liters."

**Have in mind** that due to **the rounding to an integer**, there is **data loss** and it is normal for **the sum of the percents to be 99%, not 100%**. 

### Sample Input and Output

|Input|Output|Input|Output|
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
|1000<br>100<br>120<br>3 |The pool is 66% full. Pipe 1: 45%. Pipe 2: 54%. |100<br>100<br>100<br>2.5|For 2.5 hours the pool overflows with 400 liters.|

### Hints and Guidelines

To solve the task, we read the input data, write a few conditional statements, do some calculations and print the result.

#### Processing The Input Data

Our first step is to read the input data:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/02.Pipes-in-pool-01.png)

Our next step is to **declare and initialize** a variable in which we are going to calculate how many **liters** the pool has **filled up** for the **time** the worker was **absent**. We do the calculations by **summing** the values of the flow rates of the **two pipes** and **multiplying** them by the **hours** that are given as input data:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/02.Pipes-in-pool-02.png)

#### Checking The Conditions and Processing Output Data

After we have **the value of the quantity** of water that has flown through the **pipes**, the next step is to **compare** that quantity with the volume of the pool itself.

We do that with a simple **`if-else`** statement, where the condition will be whether **the quantity of water is less than the volume of the pool**. If the statement returns **`true`**, we have to print one **line** that contains **the ratio** between the quantity of **water that has flown through the pipes** and **the volume of the pool**, as well as the **ratio of the quantity of the water** from **each pipe** to the **volume of the pool**. 

The ratio has to be in **percentage**, that is why all the calculations so far will be **multiplied by 100**. The values will be printed using **placeholders**, and as there is a condition for **the result in percentage** to be formatted to **two digits** after **the decimal** point **without rounding**, we will use the method **`Math.trunc(…)`**:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/02.Pipes-in-pool-03.png)

However, if **the condition** returns **`false`**, that means that **the quantity of water** is **more** than the **volume** of the pool, therefore, it has **overflown**. Again, the output data has to be on **one line**, but this time it should contain only two values – one of the **hours** when the worker was absent, and the **quantity of water**, which is the **difference** between *the incoming water and the volume of the pool.

## Problem: Sleepy Tom Cat

Tom Cat likes to sleep all day but, unfortunately, his owner is always playing with him whenever he has free time. To sleep well, **the norm of games** that Tom has is **30 000 minutes per year**. The time for games he has **depends on the holidays that his owner has**:
* During **workdays**, his owner plays with him **63 minutes per day**. 
* During **holidays**, his owner plays with him **127 minutes per day**. 

Write a program that reads **the number of holidays** and prints whether **Tom can sleep well** and how much **the difference from the norm** for the current year is. It is assumed that **there are 365 days in one year**. 

**Example**: 20 holidays -> the working days are 345 (365 - 20 = 345). The time for games is 24 275 minutes (345 \* 63 + 20 \* 127). The difference from the norm is 5 725 minutes (30 000 – 24 275 = 5 725) or 95 hours and 25 minutes.

### Input Data

The input is read from the console and consists of an integer – **the number of holidays** in the range of [**0 … 365**].

### Output Data

**Two lines** have to be printed on the console: 
* If Tom's time for games **is above the norm** for the current year: 
  * **On the first line** print: **“Tom will run away”**.
  * **On the second line** print the difference from the norm in the format:  
    **“{H} hours and {M} minutes more for play”**.
* If the time for games of Tom **is below the norm** for the current year:
  * **On the first line** print: **“Tom sleeps well”**.
  * **On the second line** print the difference from the norm in the format:  
   **“{H} hours and {M} minutes less for play”**.

### Sample Input and Output

|Input|Output|Input|Output|
|----|-----|----|-----|
|20|Tom sleeps well<br>95 hours and 25 minutes less for play|113|Tom will run away<br>3 hours and 47 minutes more for play|

### Hints and Guidelines

To solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.

#### Reading The Input Data and Calculating

From the task, we see that **the input data** will be **an integer** in the range of [**0 … 365**].

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/03.Sleepy-tom-cat-01.png)

To solve the problem, **first**, we have to calculate **the total minutes** the owner of Tom is playing with him. We see that not only does the sleepy cat has to play with his owner during **the holidays**, but also during **the working days**. **The number** that we read from the console refers to **the holidays**. 

Out next step is to **calculate**, with the help of that number, how many **the working days** of the owner are, as without them we cannot calculate **the total minutes for play**. As the total number of days per year is ***365*** and the number of holidays is **X**, that means that the number of working days is **365 - X***. We store **the difference** in a new variable that only stores this value:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/03.Sleepy-tom-cat-02.png)

Once we have the number of days for playing, we can calculate **the time for games** of Tom in minutes. Its **value is equal** to the **result of the multiplication of the working days by 63** minutes (the task specifies that during working days, the time for play is 63 minutes per day), **summed with the result of the multiplication of the holidays by 127** minutes (the task specifies that during holidays, the time for play is 127 minutes per day).

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/03.Sleepy-tom-cat-03.png)

In the task condition, we see that we have to **print the difference** between the two values in **hours** and **minutes** as output data. That is why we **subtract** the **total** time for play from the norm of **30 000** minutes and **store** the result in a **new** variable. After that, we **divide** that variable by 60 to get the **hours**, and then, to find out how many the **minutes** are, we use **modular division with the operator `%`**, as again we divide the variable of the difference by 60.

Here we have to note that if the total **time for the playing** of Tom is **less** than **30,000** when **subtracting** the norm from it, we will obtain **a negative number**. To **neutralize** the number in the division, we use **the method `Math.abs(…)`** when finding the difference:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/03.Sleepy-tom-cat-04.png)

#### Checking The Conditions

The time for games is already calculated, which leads us to the **next** step – **comparing** the **time for play** of Tom with the **norm** on which the good sleep of the cat depends. To do so, we will use an **`if-else`** conditional statement. In the **`if` clause** we will check whether **the time for play is more than 30 000** (the norm).

#### Processing the Output Data

Whatever the result of the conditional statement is, we have to print how much **the difference in hours and minutes** is. We will do that with a **placeholder** and the variables that store the values of the hours and the minutes, as the formatting will be according to the task requirements for output.

## Problem: Harvest

In a vineyard with an area of X square meters, **40% of the harvest goes for wine production**. **Y kilograms of grapes** are extracted from a **1 square meters vineyard**. **2,5 kg of grapes** is needed for **1 liter of wine**. The wanted quantity of wine for sale is **Z liters**.

Write a program that **calculates how much wine can be produced** and whether that quantity is enough. **If it is enough, the rest is divided between the vineyard workers equally**.

### Input Data

The input data consists of **exactly 4 lines** (arguments): 
* First line (argument): **X square meters is the vineyard size – an integer in the range of** [**10 … 5000**].
* Second line (argument): **Y grapes for one square meters – an integer in the range of** [**0.00 … 10.00**].
* Third line (argument): **Z needed liters of wine – an integer in the range of** [**10 … 600**].
* Fourth line (argument): **number of workers – an integer in the range of** [**1 … 20**].

### Output Data

The following has to be printed on the console:
* If the **produced** wine is **less than the needed quantity**:
  * **“It will be a tough winter! More {insufficient wine} liters wine needed.**”  
   \* **The result** has to be **rounded down to the nearest integer**.
* If **the produced** wine is **more than the needed quantity**:
  * **“Good harvest this year! Total wine: {total wine} liters.”**  
   \* **The result** has to be **rounded down to the nearest integer**.
  * **“{Wine left} liters left -> {wine for one worker} liters per person.”**  
   \* **Both of the results** have to be **rounded up to the higher integer**.

### Sample Input and Output

|Input|Output|Input|Output|
|----|-----|----|-----|
|650<br>2<br>175<br>3|Good harvest this year! Total wine: 208 liters.<br>33 liters left -> 11 liters per person.|1020<br>1.5<br>425<br>4|It will be a tough winter! More 180 liters wine needed.|

### Hints and Guidelines

To solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.

#### Processing The Input Data and Performing The Calculations

First, we have to **read the input data**: 

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/04.Harvest-01.png)

To solve the problem, based on the input data, we have to **calculate** how many **liters of wine** will be produced. From the task requirements, we see that to **calculate** the quantity of **wine in liters**, we first, have to find **the number of grapes in kilograms**, which we will get from the harvest. For that, we will declare a variable that keeps a **value**, equal to **40%** of the result from the **multiplication** of the vineyard area by the number of grapes, which is extracted from 1 $$m^2$$.

After having done these calculations, we are ready to **calculate the quantity of wine in liters** that will be produced from the harvest as well. For that, we declare one more variable that stores that **quantity**. To calculate, we have to **divide the number of grapes in kg by 2.5**:

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/04.Harvest-02.png)

#### Checking The Conditions and Processing Output Data

After having done the necessary calculations, the next step is to **check** whether the liters of wine that have been produced, **are enough**. For that, we will use **a simple conditional statement** of the **`if-else`** type and we will check whether the liters of wine from the harvest are **more than** or **equal to** the **needed liters**. 

If the condition returns **`true`**, from the task requirement we see that **on the first line** we have to print **the wine that has been produced from the harvest**. That value has to be **rounded down to the nearest integer**, which we will do by using both the method **`Math.floor(…)`** and a **placeholder** when printing it.

On the second line, we have to print the results by **rounding them up to the higher integer**, which we will do by using the method **`Math.ceil(…)`**. The values that we have to print are **the quantity of wine left** and **the quantity that each worker gets**. The wine left is equal to **the difference** between the produced liters of wine and the needed liters of wine. 
We calculate the value of that quantity in a new variable, which we declare and initialize in the **`if` condition body**, before printing the first line. We calculate the quantity of wine that **each worker gets** by dividing the wine left by the number of workers.

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/04.Harvest-03.png)

If the condition returns **`false`**, we have to **print the difference** between **the needed liters** and the **liters of wine produced from the harvest**. There is a specification that the result has to be **rounded down to the nearest integer**, which we will do by using the method **`Math.floor(…)`**.

## Problem: Firm

A firm gets a request for creating a project for which a certain number of hours are needed. The firm has **a certain number of days**. During 10% of the days, the workers are **being trained** and cannot work on the project. A normal **working day is 8 hours long**. The project is important for the firm and every worker must work on it with **overtime of 2 hours per day**. 

**The hours** must be **rounded down to the nearest integer** (for example, **6.98 hours** are rounded to **6 hours**).

Write a program that calculates whether **the firm can finish the project on time** and **how many hours more are needed or left**.

### Input Data

The input data contains **exactly three lines** (arguments): 
* On **the first** line (argument) are **the needed hours** – **an integer in the range of** [**0 … 200 000**].
* On **the second** line (argument) are **the days that the firm has** – **an integer in the range of** [**0 … 20 000**].
* On **the third** line (argument) are **the number of all workers** – **an integer in the range of** [**0 … 200**].

### Output Data

Print **one line** on **the console**: 
* If **the time is enough**:
  * **"Yes!{the hours left} hours left."**
* If  **the time is NOT enough**:
  * **"Not enough time!{additional hours} hours needed."**

### Sample Input and Output

|Input|Output|Input|Output|
|----|-----|----|-----|
|90<br>7<br>3<br>|Yes!99 hours left.|99<br>3<br>1|Not enough time!72 hours needed.|

### Hints and Guidelines

To solve the problem, we will read the input data. Then, we will write a few conditional statements and do some calculations. Finally, we will print the result.

#### Reading The Input Data

**First**, we have to read the input data to solve the problem.

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/05.Firm-01.png)

#### Auxiliary Calculations

The next step is to calculate **the number of total working hours** by multiplying the working days by 8 (every working day is 8 hours long) with the number of workers and then sum them with the overtime. **The working days** equal **90% of the days** that the firm has. **The overtime** equals the result of the multiplication of the number of workers by 2 (the possible hours of overtime) and then it is multiplied by the number of days that the firm has. From the task requirements, we see that **the hours** should be **rounded down to the nearest integer**, which we will do with the method **`Math.floor(…)`**.

![](assets/chapter-3-2-images/05.Firm-02.png)

#### Checking The Conditions

After having done the calculations that are needed to find the value of **the working hours**, now we have to check whether these hours are **enough**,  **or some hours are left**.

If **the time is enough**, we print the result that is specified in the task requirements, which in this case is the difference between **the working hours and the hours needed** for finishing the project. 

If **the time is not enough**, we print the additional hours that are needed for finishing the project. They equal the difference between **the hours for the project** and **the total working hours**.
